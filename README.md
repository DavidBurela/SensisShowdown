Sensis Showdown
=============

A quick app that was thrown together in 2 hours for the Microsoft Melbourne Appfest. The purpose of the app was to implement the Sensis Search API (SAPI) [http://developers.sensis.com.au/about](http://developers.sensis.com.au/about)

Want to know what is more popular in Melbourne? Pizza or Pasta, Sushi or Fries. The Sensis Showdown app retrieves the total number of results from Sensis.com.au and tells you once and for who the winner is.

Features
--------
* Search for two business or food terms to find which is the most popular
* Results are added as pushpins to the map
* Numerical results

Downloading
--------
The application can be downloaded from the Windows 8 marketplace
